This is dedicated to the heroic actions of the **BBIG Battalion** who, against all odds, courageously stood their ground and turned the tyde of war against the SS Hedge Funds on [Friday the 17th, 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/BBIG/comments/rem91f/lasers_bbig_weekend_update_quarterly_futures/) – which, later would become infamously known as the *"Bay of Apes"*. 

This marked a crucial turning point in the war against the SS Hedge Funds and their relentless months long assault – and while this battle was a decisive victory, the war is far from over...

Thank you [BBIG Battalion](https://www.reddit.com/r/BBIG/)!
